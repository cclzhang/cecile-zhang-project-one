Side Notes

--accessibility--
Font-size, line height, font-weight given are different than the sizes provided in order to match the PSD given.

Font-sizes are not accessible (too small), however, was still used to visually match the PSD given.

The 'read more' and 'find out more' links are styled like buttons and are not best practice but was still used to match PSD given.

--media queries--
More media queries and breakpoints were used for specific layouts that I personally find visually appeally. Most are not necessary for the site to run smoothly for the responsive design to match both mobile and desktop PSD given

I made some committed changed during the class on github and gits just to test out pushing the changes that I made on my local files. Please ignore it when marking this project. I will remember to wait longer before commiting new changes for projects waiting to be marked.
